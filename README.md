# Trinity

## The Game

_Trinity_ is a 1986 interactive fiction game published by [Infocom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom).

The following sources provide further information on _Trinity_:

* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(video_game))
* [The Infocom Gallery](http://infocom.elsewhere.org/gallery/trinity/trinity.html)
* [IFWiki](http://ifwiki.org/index.php/Trinity)

This repository contains the source code for the game. This source code is provided in ZIL (Zork Implementation Language), which was a specialized subset of [MDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDL_(programming_language)), which was itself a dialect of LISP. The ZIL language was created by MIT students and staff. When compiled, the game can run on any implementation of the [Z-Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-machine). Infocom used a compiler called ZILCH to compile the source code. That compiler, however, is lost. While there was a [project to bring ZILCH back](https://github.com/ZoBoRf/ZILCH-How-to), currently the only known way to compile this kind of source code is via a project like [ZILF](https://foss.heptapod.net/zilf/zilf/-/wikis/home).
